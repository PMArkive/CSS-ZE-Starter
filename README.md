# CSS-ZE-Starter

All necessary extension and custom sourcemod that needed for CS:S Zombie Escape server. Mostly used by popular CS:S Zombie Escape server.

Usually inorder to have these extensions for your server, you have to compile the extensions with yourself. 
These extensions required custom-sourcemod to work with and only for Linux. (Check out custom-sourcemod by Botox : https://github.com/BotoX/sourcemod)

All source file of extensions can be found here: https://git.botox.bz/CSSZombieEscape 

### Fact
Do not install sm-ext-A2QCache and sm-ext-connect in the same server. This might causing maptracker issues and make your server offline in maptracker.

So if you have a plan to host NoSteam server, You have to install sm-ext-connect, but do not install sm-ext-A2QCache.

If you have a plan to host Steam only server, You can install sm-ext-A2QCache as optional, but do not install sm-ext-connect.
